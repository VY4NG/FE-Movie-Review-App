Exporting moviesDataAndReviews so the information can be reused in the MovieList
compnonent. 

In this coding assignment, I have chosen to create the movies and their reviews
myself instead of pulling them from an API. The synopsis and rating is from IMDb. 
For the rating, IMDb has a rating system out of 10 stars. To satisfy this assignment 
of having a 5-star rating component, I have divided the rating in half. The imageUrl
was done through Google search and copying and pasting the image address. For the 
reviews, they are made up. 

moviesDataAndReviews is an array of object literals; this is our database with IDs.
    - reviews is an array of object literals as well.
